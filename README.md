# Women-Empowerment
A website to aware about the educating the girls
The aim of my project was to show that to educate each and every girl child in our country, that women might have the chance of a healthier and happier life. People  think that girls should stay at home and help their family. This mentality is completely wrong, so to prove the power of girls, I have made this project.
